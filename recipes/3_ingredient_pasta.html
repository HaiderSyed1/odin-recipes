    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> For weeknights or just last minute meals to feed your family, this 3 ingredient pasta is the probably the easiest dish a person can make.
        Seriously it is just boiling pasta and mixing some cream cheese and any generic tomato sauce together. This is barely considered cooking if you do not have
        time to make this you are either sick in the head or spend way too much time on Runescape
    </p>

    <p>At least add some shredded chicken as a bonus hit of protein but if not you probably already have all of the stuff in your pantry or fridge anyway.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta of any shape but a small one preferably</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce, preferably Raos since you clearly work 14 hours a day</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Some bonus stuff to add if you have it but not needed</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Red Chili flakes</li>
        <li>Any protein of your choice (Rotisserie chicken is my recommendation)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil Pasta of your choice in a pot of very lightly salted water. Only use enough water to cover the pasta no more.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is boiling, put 2 parts tomato sauce in a new pan, and add about 1 part cream cheese, add more or less depending on what you like.</li>
        <li>Drain your pasta but reserve about a cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to the pan, mix throughly, and add as much pasta water as needed to achieve the texture you desire, the starch in the water will thicken the sauce once it cools a bit.</li>
        <li> Add the optional ingredients at the end, 1 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tsp of chili flake, and optional protein. </li>
    </ol>
